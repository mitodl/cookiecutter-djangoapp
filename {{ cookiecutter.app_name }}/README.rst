Getting Started
===============

You can either run this locally with a default sqlite database after
installing the requirements.txt file, or if you have Docker and
prefer a cleaner environment, install docker-compose with ``pip
install docker-compose`` and run ``docker-compose up``. This will set
up
a near production-ready containerized development environment that
runs migrations, with the django development server running on
port 8070.

To run one-off commands, like shell, you can run
``docker-compose run web python manage.py shell`` or to create root
user, etc.

Adding an application
=====================

To add an application to this, add it to the requirements file, add
its needed settings, include its URLs, and provide any needed template
overrides.


Testing
=======

The project is set up with
`tox<https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ and
`py.test<http://pytest.org/latest/>`_. It will run pylint, pep8, and
py.test tests with coverage. It will also generate an HTML coverage
report. To run them all inside the docker image, run ``docker-compose
run web tox``, or if you are running locally, after installing the
requirements file, just run ``tox``.

Continuous Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want test to run on file changes, the
``test_requirements.txt`` adds pytest-watcher, which can be started
with
``ptw``. This unfortunately will not work well in the docker
environment
because the file events it uses are fired on the host OS, and not the
docker OS. I have added an
`issue<https://github.com/joeyespo/pytest-watch/issues/9>`_ to the
`pytest-watch repo<https://github.com/joeyespo/pytest-watch>`_
